# Overview
This repository contains the Light Logger project, which involves the acquisition of calibration data with an emphasis on spectral and directional analysis. You will find both the raw sensor and spectrometer data within this repository. The provided code is intended for data visualization and analysis.

# Dependency Management
This Python project utilizes **pip** for package management. Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to download the correct package versions (the given version or higher) and ensure computational reproducibility. When running the Python code files, make sure to use a virtual environment (e.g., created with venv or conda) to avoid issues with package dependencies and working directories.

# Workflow description 
Here we explain the Python script processing for analyzing 
- Characterization of UV channels
- Spectral sensitivity and
- Directional dependance of the novel light logger.

Each step includes the corresponding raw data, along with the data preparation and calculations necessary for visualization.

### Step 1: Characterization of UV channels
Folder: `01_UV`<br>
Input: `spectrometer_data/filtered`<br>
Output: `UV_spectrometer_code.ipynb`<br>
Code: `UV_spectrometer_code.ipynb`

### Ste 2: Spectral sensitivity

### Step 3: Directional dependance
